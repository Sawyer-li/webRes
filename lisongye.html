		Wait for love 
		Where there's will,there's a way,kindaa beautiful 
		And every night has its day, so magical 
		That can't be defeated
		For every tyrant to tear upon the vulnerable
		In every lost soul,the bones of the miracle
		For every dreamer,a dream we're  unstoppable 
		With something to believe in
